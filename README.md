# Door Sensor

This is a proximity sensor connected to a BeagleBoneBlack that is designed to be placed on the inside of a doorway. When the sensor is tripped, the BBB will send a message to the DoorListener, which will in turn send a message to your desktop, alerting you that someone has entered your office.
